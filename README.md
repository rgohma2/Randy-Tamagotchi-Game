# Randy-Tamagotchi-Game

Tamagotchi Mini-Project
Description
Let's use our front-end web development skills to create a "living" pet! We'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to interact with our pet.

Requirements
You must have a class for your Tamagotchi, a game object, and event listeners/handlers at the bottom that call methods in your game object. There should be no other code in the global scope.

You must build incrementally and make commits as you go. You will be expected to show a commit history that reflects taking careful measured steps and building one feature at a time.

Create a repo for your Tamagotchi pet on github.com and make the link available in your class Slack channel.

Create a class for your Tamagotchi. The Tamagotchi should have the following properties:

hunger (1-10 scale)
sleepiness (1-10 scale)
boredom (1-10 scale)
age
name
Add the ability to name your pet using a form. When the form is submitted, a Tamagotchi should be instantiated with the name the user typed and stored in a property of the game object.

This should also "start the game", and cause the timer to start running and the following things to happen:

The game should display a character of your choice (and its name) on the screen to represent your pet. While the pet is alive, it must move somehow. You can use CSS or jQuery animation, or you can swap out GIFs, or you can somehow manually have it moving around the screen by changing the HTML with some kind of timer. It's up to you. But there must be some kind of motion when it's alive, and it should stop when it's dead.

Clearly display the pet's age, and its hunger, boredom, and sleepiness metrics for your pet. They should be updated on the screen as they change.

Increase your pet's age every [how ever long you want].

Increase your pet's hunger, sleepiness, and boredom metrics at intervals of your choosing.

Important: There should be only one setInterval() running in your entire app. See your instructors if this a source of confusion for you.

You pet should die if hunger, boredom, or sleepiness hits 10.

Add UI elements to the page to let the user feed your pet, turn off the lights, and play with your pet.

The feed and play buttons can just change the values, but the light switch must function differently. The page should change visually to reflect the lights being off for a limited amount of time, and during that time, the sleepiness should go down instead of up (it's up to you what happens with hunger and boredom while your pet is sleeping). After a specific time interval, the lights should automatically come back on, and the game should go back to working the way it did before you turned them off.

You must morph your pet at certain ages.

Extras
Have your tomagotchi give birth to baby tomagotchi...
...with special powers (extend the class)!
Add an excercise() method to your tomagotchi, that affects certain properties
Add anything you can think of... use your imagination!
Go nuts with the animation.
